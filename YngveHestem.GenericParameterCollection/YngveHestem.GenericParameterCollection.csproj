    <Description>ParameterCollection is a simple to use collection for different parameters and types defined with a key. It supports many of the standard types like int, string, double, float, long, DateTime, bool, byte[], enums and more. It can also support nearly every other objects by easy converting the object to itÂ´s own ParameterCollection, which can be nested togheter as parameters. It also supports many of the parameters as IEnumerables (List, Array, etc.). Methods to convert to and from JSON is also included.</Description>
    <PackageReleaseNotes>
        Version 1.0.2-beta17:
        - You can now send custom converters with the GetValue- and SetValue-methods to use custom converters without needing to add them to the parameters.

        Version 1.0.2-beta16:
        - Fixed a bug in ParameterCollections generic version of method GetByKeyAndType, which made conversions not work as intended.

        Version 1.0.2-beta15:
        - You can now send in null-value in AddCustomConverter without it crash or being added if value is null.
        - Changed some in json-implementation, so ParameterCollection is added as an object instead of directly as an array. This was needed as the earlier implementation did not allow for sending references to custom converters that was added to the ParameterCollection. At the same time we fixed so properties that is null, will not be added to the actual json. This should make the json smaller if few parameters has extra parameters or custom converters.

        Version 1.0.2-beta14:
        - Fixed a bug in DateTimeParameterConverter that made converting list of DateTime not work.

        Version 1.0.2-beta13:
        - Fixed bug in SelectParameterConverter.

        Version 1.0.2-beta12:
        - Fixed so SelectParameterConverter do now allow getting the data as a ParameterConverter.

        Version 1.0.2-beta11:
        - Fixed a possible casting exception between List and Array. Now the default parameter-converters use a function to convert IEnumerables to correct type if possible.
        - Changed bytes-converter to support all IEnumerables of type byte, and not only byte-arrays.
        - Some other small fixes.

        Version 1.0.2-beta10:
        - Simplified conversion between IEnumerables.
        - Some other small changes.

        Version 1.0.2-beta09:
        - Fixed a small bug that prevented SelectionMany to be converted right.
        - Added conversion between string and ParameterType.String_IEnumerable and ParameterType.String_Multiline_IEnumerable

        Version 1.0.2-beta08:
        - Fixed a small bug that prevented DateTimeParameterConverter to convert from DateTime correctly.

        Version 1.0.2-beta07:
        - Moved some of the conversion for SelectOne and SelectMany to converter and at the same time added some more ways to convert.
        - Added the possibillity to add multiple custom converters to Parameter and ParameterCollection with one call.
        - Added a way to get all custom converters added to a Parameter or a ParameterCollection.
        - Small fixes.

        Version 1.0.2-beta06:
        - Moved some of the conversion for Enum to converter and at the same time added some more ways to convert.

        Version 1.0.2-beta05:
        - Fixed a bug that made it impossible to use the object-value constructor to create the Parameter-object

        Version 1.0.2-beta04:
        - Fixed a bug in StringParameterConverter

        Version 1.0.2-beta03:
        - Small bugfixes
        - Custom converters are now possible to send in every Parameter-constructur.

        Version 1.0.2-beta02:
        - Changed how conversion happens, so everything (except Enum, SelectOne and SelectMany), now uses own conversion-classes. This will make it easier to convert to custom types directly.
        - Added possibillity to add any object as a parameter (if it exist a converter).
        - Added possibillity to add custom converters.
        - As custom converters is added, some functions to get value by a specific type are removed.
        - Some functions to check if a parameter can convert to a value is added.

        Version 1.0.2-beta01:
        - Added the possibillity to get the value of an enum as string.
        - Added the possibillity to set a new value of an existing parameter.
